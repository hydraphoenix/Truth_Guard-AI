## üéØ Core Features to Test

### **1. Misinformation Detection Engine**

#### Test Case 1: Real News Article
```
Title: "Scientists Develop New COVID-19 Treatment"
Content: "Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new treatment for COVID-19 that shows promising results in early clinical trials. The treatment, based on monoclonal antibodies, has shown a 67% reduction in hospitalization rates among high-risk patients. The research team, led by Dr. Sarah Johnson, published their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine after a 6-month study involving 2,000 participants across 15 medical centers."

Expected Result: 
- Prediction: Real
- Confidence: 85-95%
- Risk Level: Low
```

#### Test Case 2: Fake News Example
```
Title: "SHOCKING: 5G Towers Control Your Mind!"
Content: "URGENT ALERT!!! Secret government documents EXPOSED revealing that 5G towers are actually mind control devices designed to control the population! Scientists are TERRIFIED to speak out but one brave researcher has leaked the TRUTH! The radiation from these towers can alter your DNA and make you obey government commands! Share this before it gets DELETED! Big Tech doesn't want you to know this SHOCKING secret!"

Expected Result:
- Prediction: Fake
- Confidence: 90-99%
- Risk Level: High
```

#### Test Case 3: Mixed/Satirical Content
```
Title: "Local Man Discovers Revolutionary Way to Stay Hydrated"
Content: "In a groundbreaking discovery that has scientists baffled, local resident Jim Thompson has reportedly found that drinking water helps him stay hydrated. This revolutionary finding challenges decades of conventional wisdom and has researchers scrambling to understand the implications. 'I was skeptical at first,' said Dr. Maria Rodriguez, 'but our extensive testing confirms that H2O does indeed prevent dehydration.' Thompson plans to patent his discovery."

Expected Result:
- Prediction: Real (satirical but factually accurate)
- Confidence: 70-85%
- Risk Level: Low
```

```

### **Edge Cases Testing**

#### Very Short Content
```
Content: "Breaking news!"
Expected: Warning about insufficient content for accurate analysis
```

#### Very Long Content
```

Expected: Processing within 3-5 seconds, accurate analysis
```

#### Special Characters and Formatting
```
Content: "This is a test with √©mojis üö®, sp3c!@l ch@rs, and FORMATTING issues..."
Expected: Proper handling without errors
```

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

### **Expected Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Target | How to Verify |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Processing Speed** | < 2 seconds | Time the analysis process |
| **Accuracy (Test Set)** | > 90% | Run provided test samples |
| **UI Responsiveness** | < 1 second | Navigate between features |
| **Memory Usage** | < 2GB RAM | Monitor system resources |
| **Error Rate** | < 1% | Test with various inputs |

### **Load Testing (Optional)**
```python
# For judges who want to test system limits
import concurrent.futures
import time

def stress_test():
    """Test system with multiple concurrent requests"""
    test_content = "Sample news article for load testing..."
    
    def single_request():
        # Make API call or use web interface
        return analyze_content(test_content)
    
    # Test with 10 concurrent requests
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        start_time = time.time()
        futures = [executor.submit(single_request) for _ in range(10)]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
        end_time = time.time()
    
    print(f"Processed 10 requests in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Average time per request: {(end_time - start_time) / 10:.2f} seconds")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting for Judges

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### Issue 1: Application Won't Start
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version
# Should be 3.8 or higher

# Manual dependency installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative launch method
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Issue 2: Models Not Loading
```bash
# Setup advanced model manually
python setup_advanced_model.py

# Check model files
ls models/saved_models/
```

#### Issue 3: Port Already in Use
```bash
# Use alternative port
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

#### Issue 4: Slow Performance
- **Solution**: Close other applications to free memory
- **Check**: Ensure you have at least 4GB RAM available
- **Alternative**: Use the lightweight mode (if available)

### **System Requirements Verification**

```python
# Run this diagnostic script
python test_setup.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ Python 3.8+ detected
‚úÖ Required packages installed
‚úÖ Models loaded successfully
‚úÖ Memory sufficient (4GB+ available)
‚úÖ Internet connection available
‚úÖ All systems ready for testing
```
